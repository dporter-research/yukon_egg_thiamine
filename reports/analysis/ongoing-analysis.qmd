## Distribution Visualizations

### Egg mass distributions

First, I wanted to visualize the average egg mass distribution by collection
site.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-site
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each collection site."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_site.png")
```

We can see a general increase in average egg size as the fish move up the river.
Most sites have a generally normal distribution, Chena does not but there are
only 3 fish. I decided to remove Chena and Salcha from downstream analyses. I 
can easily add them back in.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-site-no-chalcha
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each collection site. Chena and Salcha are removed."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_site_nochalcha.png")

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-thiamine-site
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass for each of the four primary collection sites. WH (Whitehorse) shows the highest mean egg mass."

# This function cleanly inserts your saved image
knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_thiamine_total_site.png")
```


## Canada-bound Fish 

Here I have filtered to only include fish genetically identified as Canada-origin
from the PIST group, I have also included fish collected at RARA, FOYU, and WH.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each Canada-bound collection site."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_canada.png")
```

The average egg mass distribution is largely unchanged when non-Canada-bound
fish are filtered out.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-mass-violin-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Average egg mass at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_site_canada.png")

```

Average egg mass is significantly different at each site along the river. Eggs
are getting larger as the fish proceed towards Whitehorse.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-thiamine-conc-violin-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Egg thiamine concentrations at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_thiamine_conc_site_canada.png")

```

Egg thiamine concentration decreases as fish migrate up the river. Fort Yukon is
not significantly different from Rampart Rapids or Whitehorse.
