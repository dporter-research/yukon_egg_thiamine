## Distribution Visualizations

### Egg mass distributions

First, I wanted to visualize the average egg mass distribution by collection
site.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-site
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each collection site."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_site.png")
```

We can see a general increase in average egg size as the fish move up the river.
Most sites have a generally normal distribution, Chena does not but there are
only 3 fish. I decided to remove Chena and Salcha from downstream analyses. I 
can easily add them back in.

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-site-no-chalcha
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each collection site. Chena and Salcha are removed."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_site_nochalcha.png")

```

## Canada-bound Fish 

Here I have filtered to only include fish genetically identified as Canada-origin
from the PIST group, I have also included fish collected at RARA, FOYU, and WH.

### Average Egg Mass

#### Distribution

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-distribution-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Mean egg mass distribution for each Canada-bound collection site."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_distribution_canada.png")
```

The average egg mass distribution is largely unchanged when non-Canada-bound
fish are filtered out.

#### Violin Plot

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-mass-violin-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Average egg mass at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_mass_site_canada.png")

```

Average egg mass is significantly different at each site along the river. Eggs
are getting larger as the fish proceed towards Whitehorse.

These data meet the assumptions of an ANOVA test. The data are mostly normally
distributed, there is homoscedasticity of variance (Levene's test p > 0.05),
and the observations are independent of each other. The observations are
independent because we are only looking at Canada-bound fish, if we were looking
at fish assigned to different "stocks" we would need to account for the random
effect of "stock".

We aren't 100% sure all the fish from RARA and FOYU are Canada "stock" we need
to be sure of this.

### Egg Thiamine Concentration 

#### Distribution

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-thiamine-conc-density-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Egg thiamine concentration distributions at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_thiamine_concentration_distribution_canada.png")

```

Distributions become more normal as fish migrate upriver and egg thiamine
concentration drops.

#### Violin Plot

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-thiamine-conc-violin-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Egg thiamine concentrations at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_thiamine_conc_site_canada.png")

```

Egg thiamine concentration decreases as fish migrate up the river. Fort Yukon is
not significantly different from Whitehorse.

Data are not normally distributed in each group and variance is not homoscedastic,
so ANOVA could not be used. Instead I tested the difference between groups 
using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and used a post-hoc Dunn's test
with Bonferroni adjustment. The Kruskal-Wallis test compares the group medians
(mean ranks) rather than the means like an ANOVA. Because the variance of 
each group is not homoscedastic, all we can confidently say is that the distributions
of the different groupings are different.

### Egg Percent Moisture

#### Distribution

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-pct_moisture-density-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Egg thiamine % moisture distributions at Canada-bound collection sites."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_pct_moisture_distribution_canada.png")

```

#### Violin Plot

```{r}
#| label: fig-egg-pct-moisture-violin-canada
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Egg % moisture of Canada-bound fish."

knitr::include_graphics("../../output/figures/egg_pct_moisture_site_canada.png")

```

Here, we are comparing group medians because the variance is homoscedastic, but
the data are not normally distributed. Again we used a Kruskal-Wallis test and
a post-hoc Dunn's test.
